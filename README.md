# how 2 setup the thing that renames connections to friends after extracting it

Go to MANAGE EXTENSIONS (click the puzzle icon on the top right near the corner)

click on DEVELOPER MODE

there will be random buttons popping up but you need to click LOAD UNPACKED

then select the folder you downloaded and extracted (the folder that renames connections to friends)

and your done, go to roblox website to see if it worked!

if it worked then good job, you can now live when you could have friends on roblox! instead of those STINKY connections!

if it DID NOT WORK, then uhhhh idk, guess thats too bad, sorry if it didnt work i guess but idk what to do about it so yeah, anyways yeah this is my first extension i made,
so uh yeah thats all thank u for readin
